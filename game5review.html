<h1>Game 5 Review</h1>

<p style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.6; color: black; text-align: left;">


The Celtics defeated the Knicks 127-102 to get to a game 6 down 3-2. This game was the last thing most people expected, especially given it was tied at halftime. The defense was excellent the entire game, and the offense stayed consistent to their identity without getting flustered during a momentum shift. 

<br><br>

The first half was a tie game, with Derrick White and Jaylen Brown doing a lot of the heavy lifting, scoring 36 of the teams 59 points on 62/75 splits. The biggest aspect that kept them in the game, however, was the Knicks 2 recent additions in OG Anunoby and Mikal Bridges struggling mightily, scoring just 12 combined points on 4/17 shooting. 

<br><br> 

It is reasonable to expect KAT and Brunson to score 25-30 each, but once OG and Mikal get going, it can cause a lot of problems. Jaylen Brown stepped up massively on the defensive end, picking up Brunson full court and keeping the pressure on the ball handlers late into the clock, forcing a bad shot. 

<br><br> 

There has been a lot of chatter amongst Celtic fans about what the team should do with Jaylen Brown in the offseason, given his massive contract relative to his level of play. This game quickly proved that it would be a massive blunder if the team was to move him. His leadership, his defense, and his shot creation is simply too valuable on this team no matter how much he may affect the team' salary cap.

The third quarter is when the Celtics were able to grab a big lead and never let New York get close again. The Celtics outscored the Knicks 32-17, causing the Knicks to shoot 4/20 from the field while the Celtics shot 8/18, but added on with 12 more free throws. A big reason the Knicks struggled so much on offense was Luke Kornet, who has seen an increased role in the regular season, but up to this point was mostly an afterthought in the postseason. 

<br><br> 

Kornet had 5 blocks in this quarter alone, causing the Knicks to not get any easy shots at or away from the rim. On top of Kornet's massive impact was the Knicks foul trouble. OG had 3 fouls in the third, while Brunson picked up 5. They targeted him all quarter and led to easy offense. This is what fans have been begging for all series. Targeting mismatches is a huge part of the Celtics mismatches, especially when a player is in foul trouble, and it was a huge reason the game got blown open. 

<br><br>

The 4th quarter would be much of the same, with the Celtics outscoring the Knicks 36-26. The Knicks only made 6/14 shots but made 12/17 free throws to carry the offense. Jalen Brunson fouled out after playing just 4 minutes, and the game was iced from there. 

<br><br>

The Celtics shot 62/46 splits in the 4th, with huge contributions coming from Jaylen Brown, Al Horford, Jrue Holiday and Payton Pritchard. They kept moving the ball, allowing everyone to contribute without the offense becoming isolation heavy, and the Celtics cruised, what a concept. A big reason for this was once again Jaylen Brown, recording 12 assists in the game. He has improved massively as a playmaker since 2023, and it is evident. He is much more patient and willing to not play 1-on-1, and it benefits everyone. '

<br><br>

The Celtics will go on the road to New York for game 6 on Friday, free of expectations and pressure. Nobody thinks they can come back, and that is exactly what is needed for them to win. The 4th quarter pressure has crushed them in this series, but with Tatum out down 3-1, it could be the perfect recipe for something spectacular.
